The new sword\u0026rsquo;s stats were similar enough to the one my character was currently using that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me which one was better. I was still fairly new to R at the time, so I used this as an opportunity to test out for loops, if statements, and functions in more depth.\nI ended up writing a script that accepted inputs that a typical Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons (D\u0026amp;D) player would be actively using: Statistics about their character, the opposing character (or monster!), the number of dice they roll when they attack, and so on.\nIn the short term I found out that the new weapon was better, but this example has served as an ongoing learning experience for me outside of gameplay. I eventually updated the script when I started playing with the new rules of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition (5e), and then again when I wanted to dig into building Shiny apps with R.\nI now have two versions of this as a Shiny app on shinyapps.io:\n My standard version built for a character of the barbarian class in D\u0026amp;D 5th Edition. Test it here. A rewrite of the standard version using the purrr package to change how simulation runs are handled. This is slower than the original version of the app, but I found it to be a useful case for understanding how the map() family can be put to use for simulation. Test it here.  Both versions of the app provide a couple of pieces of output for the inquisitive D\u0026amp;D player:\n A histogram of the total damage done by the character for each of the simulation runs Lines on the histogram and printed text showing the mean and median damage done over the course of the simulated runs A tab containing a table of hit statistics: All of the amounts of damage their character did over the simulation runs, the raw number of times each amount of damage was done, and the percentage of the time that amount of damage was done  These outputs were helpful as a Pathfinder/D\u0026amp;D player, and as I reviewed them I ended up learning more than that my character\u0026rsquo;s new sword was an improvement. For example, what I had not realized while throwing dice down on the table was just how frequently a character misses. Using the current base settings for the D\u0026amp;D 5e barbarian simulation shows that a character should expect to miss ~30% of the time they take a swing. This might be dismaying, but also could be a bit of a confidence boost for anyone who feels like they have bad luck a lot.\nYou can find the scripts for this app on GitHub here.\n","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"3bc7ca762196b1476db49fa7e2c0f7ba","permalink":"brousil.science/project/5e_sim/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"brousil.science/project/5e_sim/","section":"project","summary":"I wrote a short Shiny app to simulate some game mechanics in Dungeons and Dragons in order to visualize and quantify how probability affects game outcomes.","tags":["Shiny"],"title":"Dungeons and Dragons Simulation with Shiny","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\rBackground The caret R package has been a staple of machine learning (ML) methods in R for a long time. The name caret stands for \u0026ldquo;Classification and Regression Training\u0026rdquo; according to the authors. It provides methods for common ML steps, such as pre-processing, training, tuning, and evaluating predictive models.\nIn addition to caret, there is also a group of packages referred to as tidymodels that is currently in development and which is also available for use. Both caret and tidymodels have Max Kuhn as a main author, but tidymodels aims to streamline ML for use with tidyverse packages.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on caret in this intro. We\u0026rsquo;ll be working with data from the palmerpenguins package, and using the caret, and tidyverse packages.\nWorking with data Start by loading the necessary packages:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(palmerpenguins)\rlibrary(caret)\r We\u0026rsquo;ll use the penguins dataset from palmerpenguins. It will be loaded automatically when you load the palmerpenguins package:\nhead(penguins)\r \r\rspecies \risland \rbill_length_mm \rbill_depth_mm \rflipper_length_mm \rbody_mass_g \rsex \ryear \r\r\r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \r39.1 \r18.7 \r181 \r3750 \rmale \r2007 \r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \r39.5 \r17.4 \r186 \r3800 \rfemale \r2007 \r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \r40.3 \r18.0 \r195 \r3250 \rfemale \r2007 \r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \rNA \rNA \rNA \rNA \rNA \r2007 \r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \r36.7 \r19.3 \r193 \r3450 \rfemale \r2007 \r\r\rAdelie \rTorgersen \r39.3 \r20.6 \r190 \r3650 \rmale \r2007 \r\r\r\rThis package contains LTER data for three penguin species on islands in Antarctica.\nReviewing the data caret provides a function called featurePlot(), which is used to visualize datasets. It runs off of the lattice package, so if you are familiar with this method of plotting you might find it familiar. As someone who primarily uses ggplot2 I found this function a bit difficult to use, but you may find it helpful still. Max Kuhn\u0026rsquo;s The caret` Package Bookdown document provides some interesting examples of its functionality. Here\u0026rsquo;s a basic plot with a couple of our variables:\nfeaturePlot(x = penguins[, c(\u0026quot;bill_length_mm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bill_depth_mm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;flipper_length_mm\u0026quot;)], y = penguins$body_mass_g, plot = \u0026quot;scatter\u0026quot;, layout = c(3, 1))\r In the plot above, the x-axis corresponds to each predictor (by panel) and the y-axis is body_mass_g.\nPre-processing caret has built-in functionality to help with pre-processing your data as well. There are some more sophisticated options, but here we\u0026rsquo;ll just take a look at one. For example, in some modeling situations you\u0026rsquo;ll want to check for correlated predictors (multicollinearity). The caret function for this is findCorrelation().\nFirst we\u0026rsquo;ll want to make a correlation matrix, which will be fed into findCorrelation().\npenguin_cor \u0026lt;- penguins %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(!if_any(everything(), is.na)) %\u0026gt;%\r# Numeric columns only\rselect(where(is.numeric)) %\u0026gt;%\rcor()\r Then findCorrelation() will check for correlations above a cutoff value that we provide:\nfindCorrelation(x = penguin_cor,\r# Use 0.7 correlation cutoff\rcutoff = 0.7,\r# Provide more details\rverbose = TRUE,\r# Return column names instead of indices\rnames = TRUE)\r ## Compare row 3 and column 4 with corr 0.873 ## Means: 0.564 vs 0.334 so flagging column 3 ## All correlations \u0026lt;= 0.7\r ## [1] \u0026quot;flipper_length_mm\u0026quot;\r It notes that row 3 and column 4 of our correlation object have a correlation of 0.87:\n## bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\r## bill_length_mm 1.0000000 -0.2286256 0.6530956 0.58945111\r## bill_depth_mm -0.2286256 1.0000000 -0.5777917 -0.47201566\r## flipper_length_mm 0.6530956 -0.5777917 1.0000000 0.87297890\r## body_mass_g 0.5894511 -0.4720157 0.8729789 1.00000000\r## year 0.0326569 -0.0481816 0.1510679 0.02186213\r## year\r## bill_length_mm 0.03265690\r## bill_depth_mm -0.04818160\r## flipper_length_mm 0.15106792\r## body_mass_g 0.02186213\r## year 1.00000000\r This means flipper_length_mm (row 3) and body_mass_g (column 4) are correlated. That\u0026rsquo;s fine since body mass is our response variable.\nSplitting the data We\u0026rsquo;ll want to make a training dataset with which to build our model. caret provides some methods for doing this, including some for balanced splits for classification datasets, splitting using maximum dissimilarity, splitting for time series, and more.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll proceed by modeling body_mass_g. First we\u0026rsquo;ll remove NAs, then do a basic split into a training dataset.\nmodel_data \u0026lt;- penguins %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(!if_any(everything(), is.na))\r# 80% of the data for training - these are row indices\rset.seed(500)\rtraining_indices \u0026lt;- createDataPartition(y = model_data$body_mass_g, p = .8,\r# Do not return a list\rlist = FALSE)\r# Subset the rows selected above\rtraining_sample \u0026lt;- model_data[training_indices, ]\r Modeling With our data in hand we now can progress to training a model. We\u0026rsquo;ll use a random forest for this example. Note that there is a lot to explore in caret that I won\u0026rsquo;t go over here. I highly recommend reading The caret` Package.\nFirst we can use the trainControl() function to customize the model training process:\ntrain_params \u0026lt;- trainControl(\r# Repeated K-fold cross-validation\rmethod = \u0026quot;repeatedcv\u0026quot;,\r# 10 folds\rnumber = 10,\r# 3 repeats\rrepeats = 3\r)\r Now we can train the random forest with the parameters above:\nset.seed(500)\rrf_model \u0026lt;- train(\r# Modeling formula indicating to model body_mass_g using all other vars\rform = body_mass_g ~ .,\r# Our custom parameters\rtrControl = train_params,\r# The dataset\rdata = training_sample,\r# Use a random forest\rmethod = \u0026quot;rf\u0026quot;\r)\r Here are our results:\n# Note that mtry = the number of randomly selected predictors caret uses at each split\rrf_model\r ## Random Forest ## ## 268 samples\r## 7 predictor\r## ## No pre-processing\r## Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 3 times) ## Summary of sample sizes: 242, 241, 242, 241, 241, 242, ... ## Resampling results across tuning parameters:\r## ## mtry RMSE Rsquared MAE ## 2 291.4107 0.8760304 233.9042\r## 5 291.0023 0.8739321 234.9932\r## 9 295.2779 0.8700284 240.0389\r## ## RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.\r## The final value used for the model was mtry = 5.\r The final model can be accessed from the trained object.

Managed pollinator species, like honey bees, and wild species are key ecosystem service providers in both natural and managed agroecosystems. However, relatively few studies have exhaustively characterized pollinator populations in diverse agroecosystems over multiple years, while also thoroughly documenting plant-pollinator interactions. Yet, such studies are needed to fulfill the national pollinator protection plans that have been released by the United States and other nations. Our research is among the first studies to respond to these directives by systematically documenting bee and plant biodiversity, bee-plant interactions, and bee-mediated pollen movement in farming systems of the Pacific Northwest, USA. Our data provides insight into the processes mediating pollinator and plant community assembly, persistence, and resilience across landscapes with variable crop and landscape diversity and agroecosystem management practices. These data will also contribute to the development of a United States pollinator database, supporting the United States’ plan to promote pollinators. With few publicly available datasets that systematically take account of agroecosystem practices, plant populations, and pollinators, our research will provide future users the means to conduct synesthetic studies of pollinators and ecosystem function in a period of rapid and global pollinator declines.

And regex is a tool for doing this.\nAs a conceptual example, consider the sentence below:\n“The user’s phone number is (555) 555-5555.”\nThis string of text could be something scraped from a PDF, or perhaps provided as input to a survey. Our end goal might be to extract and store the phone number in that sentence. One way to do this would be to write a regular expression that describes the pattern of a phone number, which R can then use to extract the phone number from the string.\nAnother common example is pulling metadata from filenames. If you have a folder of rasters with names like \u0026quot;farm_aerial_imagery_whitman_county_2021.tiff\u0026quot;, you might want to filter them based on their contents. Using regex we can give R instructions to separate out the county name and year from the filenames, which allows us to determine the spatial and temporal coverage of our files.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ll go through a few examples. If you want to follow along, you can download the .zip folder from here. Make sure to unzip the folder and open the script it contains. We\u0026rsquo;ll fill it in below:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(stringi)\r Note that tidyverse contains the stringr package, which contains a variety of useful functions for working with strings. We\u0026rsquo;ll barely scratch the surface of its capabilities here.\n1. A simple example of regex A common application of regex is to extract numbers from text data. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have this filename:\nfilename \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;2021A.txt\u0026quot;\r This is how we could confirm the presence of just the year from it using base R: We could search for the year verbatim, returning a logical T/F with grepl().\ngrepl(pattern = \u0026quot;2021\u0026quot;, x = filename)\r ## [1] TRUE\r Or we could generalize it to just identifying where a number occurs. We use a pattern to identifying numbers 0 through 9:\ngrepl(pattern = \u0026quot;[0-9]\u0026quot;, x = filename)\r ## [1] TRUE\r More helpful would be to find four numbers in a row, as indicated with our bracketed 4:\ngrepl(pattern = \u0026quot;[0-9]{4}\u0026quot;, x = filename)\r ## [1] TRUE\r And then finally to actually return those numbers to us using str_extract() so that we can use them:\n?str_extract\r str_extract(string = filename, pattern = \u0026quot;[0-9]{4}\u0026quot;)\r ## [1] \u0026quot;2021\u0026quot;\r Now you might imagine that we could take this one step further and pull the dates from an entire vector of filenames.

This syntax allows us to group parts of a text string, for example as a means of ensuring that the data we\u0026rsquo;re editing meets certain conditions (e.g., for quality control).\nTo do this we denote groups with parentheses: ( ). So, for example, we could use the following lines of code to \u0026ldquo;capture\u0026rdquo; the pieces of our dates: \u0026quot;([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{4})\u0026quot;\nThen we can refer to the date pieces by numbers, in the order they are written.

We surveyed 40-km of Lake Baikal's southwestern shoreline from 19 to 23 August 2015 for sewage indicators, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and microplastics, with colocated periphyton, macroinvertebrate, stable isotope, and fatty acid samplings. The data are structured in a tidy format (a tabular arrangement familiar to limnologists) to encourage reuse. Unique identifiers corresponding to sampling locations are retained throughout all data files to facilitate interoperability among the dataset's 150+ variables. For Lake Baikal studies, these data can support continued monitoring and research efforts. For global studies of lakes, these data can help characterize sewage prevalence and ecological consequences of anthropogenic disturbance across spatial scales.","tags":null,"title":"A unified dataset of co-located sewage pollution, periphyton, and benthic macroinvertebrate community and food web structure from Lake Baikal (Siberia)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert N.

Most crops are grown within heterogeneous landscapes, and interactions between management practices and landscape context often affect plant and animal biodiversity in agroecosystems. However, whether these same factors typically affect crop-associated microbiota is less clear. Here, we assessed whether orchard management strategies and landscape context affected bacterial and fungal communities in pear (Pyrus communis) flowers. We found that bacteria and fungi responded differently to management schemes. Organically certified orchards had higher fungal diversity in flowers than conventional or bio-based integrated pest management (IPM) orchards, but organic orchards had the lowest bacterial diversity. Orchard management scheme also best predicted the distribution of several important bacterial and fungal genera that either cause or suppress disease; organic and bio-based IPM best explained the distributions of bacterial and fungal genera, respectively. Moreover, patterns of bacterial and fungal diversity were affected by interactions between management, landscape context, and climate. When examining the similarity of bacterial and fungal communities across sites, both abundance- and taxon-related turnovers were mediated primarily by orchard management scheme and landscape context and, specifically, the amount of land in cultivation. Our study reveals local- and landscape-level drivers of floral microbiome structure in a major fruit crop, providing insights that can inform microbiome management to promote host health and high-yielding quality fruit. **IMPORTANCE** Proper crop management during bloom is essential for producing disease-free tree fruit. Tree fruits are often grown in heterogeneous landscapes; however, few studies have assessed whether landscape context and crop management affect the floral microbiome, which plays a critical role in shaping plant health and disease tolerance. Such work is key for identification of tactics and/or contexts where beneficial microbes proliferate and pathogenic microbes are limited. Here, we characterize the floral microbiome of pear crops in Washington State, where major production occurs in intermountain valleys and basins with variable elevation and microclimates. Our results show that both local-level (crop management) and landscape-level (habitat types and climate) factors affect floral microbiota but in disparate ways for each kingdom. More broadly, these findings can potentially inform microbiome management in orchards for promotion of host health and high-quality yields.","tags":null,"title":"Orchard Management and Landscape Context Mediate the Pear Floral Microbiome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625529600,"objectID":"475f2249a5c02879faf32697c0e89e6e","permalink":"brousil.science/portfolio/","publishdate":"2021-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"brousil.science/portfolio/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Organizer, moderator, and co-instructor of a three-day workshop covering data management techniques and an introduction to R.

However, global declines in bee populations threaten the delivery of pollination services in both managed and natural ecosystems. Alternative pollinators such as flies, butterflies, beetles, and wasps may provide a buffer that protects agriculture from bee population declines. Flower-visiting flies are abundant in both rural and urban agricultural settings, and in some cases may pollinate plants avoided by bees. Here we explored the structure of plant-pollinator networks for both bee and non-bee pollinator communities across rural and urban farms in western Washington State, USA. We identified several broad groups of pollinators comprising 13 morphogroups of insects and arthropods. While bees were the pollinators observed on reproductive parts of flowers most frequently, syrphid flies contributed to a high number of arthropod-flower visits. We also found that syrphid flies visited four plant types not visited by bees, and that urban and rural farm settings were characterized by different syrphid fly communities. When comparing the networks of plant-arthropod interactions, urban farm settings had more diverse networks overall, with a greater richness of plant-arthropod interactions for both bee and non-bee pollinators. These findings underscore the need for greater focus on alternative pollinators as contributors to pollination services, particularly in urban settings where pollination services may be more impacted by bee declines and habitat loss. Our work will inform specific pollinator conservation efforts in the Pacific Northwest region and more broadly across the United States.","tags":["Landscape ecology","Plant-pollinator networks","Pollinators","Bipartite networks","Alternative pollinators"],"title":"Interactions between plants and pollinators across urban and rural farming landscapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert N.
