I'm a research coordinator for the [WSU Decision Aid System](https://decisionaid.systems/). I organize and synthesize pest and climate data and use R to translate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) research into useful tools for decision makers in Washington State agriculture. I also develop new decision aid models and expand our IPM programs through research.

In addition to this work I also enjoy [running workshops]({{< relref "/event/" >}}) and giving [instructional talks]({{< relref "/talk/" >}}) about reproducible research and R. 

Previously I was a data manager for the [Center for Environmental Research, Education and Outreach (CEREO)](cereo.wsu.edu/) and research assistant for the Hampton Lab at WSU. In those roles I worked on projects spanning the fields of limnology, ecology, entomology, and agriculture. I have a BA/BS in ecology and agriculture from The Evergreen State College and a MS in forestry sciences from California Polytechnic State University.
