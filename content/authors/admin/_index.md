Iâ€™m a data manager for the Center for Environmental Research, Education and Outreach (CEREO) and research assistant for the Hampton Lab at Washington State University. My work covers a variety of topics and applications, including performing analyses, consulting on data organization and analysis, performing code review, and designing publication-quality graphics. I work on projects spanning the fields of limnology, ecology, entomology, and agriculture.

I received my BA/BS in ecology and agriculture at The Evergreen State College and my MS in forestry sciences at California Polytechnic State University. Previously, I worked on agriculture and entomology research projects covering topics such as insect pollinator health and pollination services in the Pacific Northwest.
