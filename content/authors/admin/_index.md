I'm a lead data scientist in the [Radical Open Science Syndicate (ROSS)](https://rossyndicate.com/) where I oversee projects integrating open science techniques with large, open water quality and remote sensing datasets. I also specialize in using workflow management techniques to build reproducible workflows in R. 

In addition to this work I also enjoy [running workshops]({{< relref "/event/" >}}) and giving [instructional talks]({{< relref "/talk/" >}}) about reproducible research and R.

Previously I was a data scientist for the [WSU Decision Aid System](https://decisionaid.systems/). In that role I organized and synthesized pest and climate data and used R to translate integrated pest management research into useful tools for decision makers in Washington State agriculture. Before that I worked on projects spanning the fields of limnology, ecology, entomology, and agriculture.
