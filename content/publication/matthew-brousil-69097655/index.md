This is a dataset containing lake surface area for > 1.42 million lakes and reservoirs >= 10 hectares in area, matched with basin-level temperature, precipitation, and population data. Data are a time series covering 1995 to 2015 (although resolution differs by variable). The dataset is intended to be fully reproducible: all scripts and a standardized file structure are available with the full dataset.
