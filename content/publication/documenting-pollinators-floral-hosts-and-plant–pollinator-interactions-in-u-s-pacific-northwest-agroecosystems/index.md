abstract: The abundance and diversity of pollinator populations are in global
  decline. Managed pollinator species, like honey bees, and wild species are key
  ecosystem service providers in both natural and managed agroecosystems.
  However, relatively few studies have exhaustively characterized pollinator
  populations in diverse agroecosystems over multiple years, while also
  thoroughly documenting plant-pollinator interactions. Yet, such studies are
  needed to fulfill the national pollinator protection plans that have been
  released by the United States and other nations. Our research is among the
  first studies to respond to these directives by systematically documenting bee
  and plant biodiversity, bee-plant interactions, and bee-mediated pollen
  movement in farming systems of the Pacific Northwest, USA. Our data provides
  insight into the processes mediating pollinator and plant community assembly,
  persistence, and resilience across landscapes with variable crop and landscape
  diversity and agroecosystem management practices. These data will also
  contribute to the development of a United States pollinator database,
  supporting the United States’ plan to promote pollinators. With few publicly
  available datasets that systematically take account of agroecosystem
  practices, plant populations, and pollinators, our research will provide
  future users the means to conduct synesthetic studies of pollinators and
  ecosystem function in a period of rapid and global pollinator declines. There
  are no copyright or proprietary restrictions for research or teaching
  purposes. Usage of the data set must be cited.
