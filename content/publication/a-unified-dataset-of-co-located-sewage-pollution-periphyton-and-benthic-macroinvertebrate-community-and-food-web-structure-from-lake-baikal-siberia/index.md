abstract: Sewage released from lakeside development can introduce nutrients and
  micropollutants that can restructure aquatic ecosystems. Lake Baikal, the
  world's most ancient, biodiverse, and voluminous freshwater lake, has been
  experiencing localized sewage pollution from lakeside settlements. Nearby
  increasing filamentous algal abundance suggests benthic communities are
  responding to localized pollution. We surveyed 40-km of Lake Baikal's
  southwestern shoreline from 19 to 23 August 2015 for sewage indicators,
  including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and microplastics, with
  colocated periphyton, macroinvertebrate, stable isotope, and fatty acid
  samplings. The data are structured in a tidy format (a tabular arrangement
  familiar to limnologists) to encourage reuse. Unique identifiers corresponding
  to sampling locations are retained throughout all data files to facilitate
  interoperability among the dataset's 150+ variables. For Lake Baikal studies,
  these data can support continued monitoring and research efforts. For global
  studies of lakes, these data can help characterize sewage prevalence and
  ecological consequences of anthropogenic disturbance across spatial scales.
