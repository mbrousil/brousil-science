*Targets for ecologists* is a `{bookdown}` resource showing how to use the `{targets}` workflow management package to build research pipelines with R. It was adapted from two, three-hour workshops on the `{drake}` package run in 2020 and 2021 through Washington State Universityâ€™s CEREO.  `{drake}` is the predecessor to the current `{targets}` package. The original workshop materials were roughly formatted for workshops styled after the Carpentries. The goal is to present these materials in a `{bookdown}` format to enable ecologists to learn the basics of creating workflows with targets through a hands-on approach. This is a living document that may receive edits in the future.
